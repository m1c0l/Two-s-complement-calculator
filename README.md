# Two's Complement Conversions Calculator

This library contains functions to calculate the two's complement of a decimal number and vice-versa; the two's complement representation is available in both binary and hexadecimal representation. 

These functions support 32-bit integers, from -2147483648 to 2147483647, since they make use of JavaScript's bitwise operators, which work for this range of numbers.
